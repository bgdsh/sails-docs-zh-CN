# Custom Adapters

Sails makes it fairly easy to write your own database adapter.  Custom adapters can be built directly in your app (`api/adapters/`) or published as NPM packages.  Check out [Intro to Custom Adapters](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/contributing/intro-to-custom-adapters.md), the [Adapter Interface Reference](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/contributing/adapter-specification.md), and [sails-adapter-boilerplate](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-adapter-boilerplate) for more information about creating your own adapter.
